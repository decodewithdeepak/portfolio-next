### Bio/Introduction

"Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Deepak Modi, a final-year CS student who somehow turned a 'Hello World' tutorial into a full-blown coding obsession. I've built stuff like NotesNeo (because finding notes shouldn't be a treasure hunt), NeoCode (the coding platform I wish existed when I started), and NeoCompiler (for when you need to test code but your laptop is being dramatic). When I'm not wrestling with React hooks or trying to make my CSS actually work, you'll find me solving LeetCode problems or experimenting with whatever shiny new tech caught my attention this week."

## About Me Sections

### Who I Am

- A guy who fell in love with code and can't stop building stuff
- I get excited when I solve tricky bugs (yeah, I'm that weird ðŸ˜…)
- Always learning something new and fitting it into my projects

### What I Do

- I turn coffee into web apps â˜• â†’ ðŸ’» (and vice versa sometimes)
- Love cracking algorithmic puzzles - like sudoku but with rewards
- Share my learnings with others because we all grow together ðŸŒ±

### My Goals

- Become the dev who can handle anything - you just name it
- Land a sweet job and finally afford good coffee â˜• (and rent ðŸ˜…)

### My Philosophy
